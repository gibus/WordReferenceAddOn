# WordReferenceAddOn
Code of the WordReference Add-On for Mozilla Firefox

This is something I didn't expect to do... When Mozilla changed the way that Firefox's add-ons worked, most of them became outdated and didn't work anymore. I used one that translated in WordReference the selected word, so I made it again. I've never used JavaScript, so I made a rudimentary add-on which creates an option in the contextual menu when there's text selected, opening a new tab with the translation of that word from Spanish to English in WordReference. I had to upload it to Mozilla before I could use it, and when it was approved I was offered to share the Add-on, and I accepted. 

It has reached hundreds of downloads and people is asking me for improvements, like a settings page allowing to change the language from spanish to any other one, and more stuff I don't know how to do. For now, I've got a job non-related with development, so I can't spend time on learning JavaScript, but maybe someday I will. In the meantime, I share the code of this add-on, allowing everyone to improve it and make the changes suggested by the users.
